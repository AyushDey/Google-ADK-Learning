1. Core Concept

Multi-agent systems in Agent Development Kit (ADK) use a tree structure: Parent agent → Sub-agents 
Agents can transfer conversation:To sub-agent 
Back to parent 
To peer agent (same parent) 
Peer transfer can be disabled for control. 
Why tree structure?Predictable and reliable conversations. 
Prevents calling wrong agents in complex systems. 


2. Types of Agents
LLM-based Agents

Act as the “brains” of the application. 
Powered by Large Language Models: Understand natural language. 
Make decisions. 
Use tools effectively. 
Alternate turns with users. 
Workflow Agents

Control flow between sub-agents. 
Not powered by LLMs → They don’t reason, just orchestrate. 
Ensure deterministic execution: Same input → same sequence. 
Useful for structured, predictable processes. 


3. Workflow Agent Types

Sequential Agent: Executes agents one after another in a fixed order. 
Example: Order Processing → Validation → Inventory → Payment → Confirmation. 
Loop Agent: Repeats a set of agents until a condition is met. 
Example: Research Agent → Fetch data → Analyze → Check completeness → Repeat if needed. 
Parallel Agent: Runs multiple agents simultaneously. 
Best for tasks with independent sub-tasks. 
Example: Generate reports for different regions in parallel. 
Custom Workflow Agent: Define custom orchestration logic. 
For complex workflows, stateful interactions, and business rules. 


4. Key Benefits

Predictability: Tree structure + deterministic workflows. 
Flexibility: Custom agents for advanced needs. 
Performance: Parallel execution for speed. 


✅ Memory Tip:
Think of ADK workflow agents as Directors:

Sequential = “Step-by-step director” 
Loop = “Repeat until perfect” 
Parallel = “All at once” 
Custom = “Creative director”
