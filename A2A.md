## Overview
The Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol addresses a critical challenge in the AI landscape: enabling Gen AI agents, built on diverse frameworks by different companies running on separate servers, to communicate and collaborate effectively - as agents, not just as tools. A2A aims to provide a common language for agents, fostering a more interconnected, powerful, and innovative AI ecosystem.

A2A is built around a few core concepts that make it powerful and flexible:

Standardized Communication: JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S).
- Agent Discovery: Agent Cards detail an agent's capabilities and connection info, so agents can discover each other and learn about each other's capabilities
- Rich Data Exchange: Handles text, files, and structured JSON data.
- Flexible Interaction: Supports synchronous request/response, streaming (SSE), and asynchronous push notifications.
- Enterprise-Ready: Designed with security, authentication, and observability in mind.
