## **Overview:**

- **Agent Engine** is a fully managed runtime on Vertex AI for Gen AI developers to deploy, manage, and scale agents in production.
- Compatible with ADK (Agent Development Kit) and other open-source frameworks.

## Core Features:

- **Scalable Deployment:** Reliable cloud-based deployments with Google Cloud.
- **Security:** Handles VPC-SC, authentication, and access management.
- **Agent Management:** API for agent lifecycle, session & memory management, user interface to list/view/converse with agents.
- **Monitoring & Analytics:** Tools to observe agent activity and performance.
- **Evaluation:** Built-in evaluation tools to assess agent quality; Example Store for continual improvement.

## **Framework Compatibility:**

- **Framework Agnostic:** Supports Vertex AI Agent Framework, and 3rd-party frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph, Crew AI, etc.).

## **Development Workflow:**

1. **Develop, Monitor, Evaluate, Test** agent.
2. **Register & Deploy** agent on Agent Engine.
3. **Query** agent via your app interface.

### **How Agent Engine Helps:**

- **Shortest Path to Success:** Reduces frictions from timeouts, model choices, CI/CD, security, and analytics.
- **Reduction of Bottlenecks:** Provides comprehensive end-to-end solution—model definition, tool setup, deployment, and querying.

## **Steps to Deploy:**

- Define model, tools & agent.
- Test locally.
- Deploy agent to a remote app via Agent Engine.
- Query agent through your app.
