# MCPToolset

The `MCPToolset` class is ADK's primary mechanism for integrating tools from an MCP server. When you include an `MCPToolset` instance in your agent's `tools` list, it automatically handles the interaction with the specified MCP server. Here's how it works:

- **Connection Management**: On initialization, `MCPToolset` establishes and manages the connection to the MCP server. This can be a local server process (using `StdioServerParameters` for communication over standard input/output) or a remote server (using `SseServerParams` for Server-Sent Events). The toolset also handles the graceful shutdown of this connection when the agent or application terminates.
- **Tool Discovery & Adaptation**: Once connected, `MCPToolset` queries the MCP server for its available tools (via the `list_tools` MCP method). It then converts the schemas of these discovered MCP tools into ADK-compatible `BaseTool` instances.
- **Exposure to Agent**: These adapted tools are then made available to your `LlmAgent` as if they were native ADK tools.
- **Proxying Tool Calls**: When your `LlmAgent` decides to use one of these tools, `MCPToolset` transparently proxies the call (using the `call_tool` MCP method) to the MCP server, sends the necessary arguments, and returns the server's response back to the agent.
- **Filtering (Optional)**: You can use the `tool_filter` parameter when creating an MCPToolset to select a specific subset of tools from the MCP server, rather than exposing all of them to your agent.
